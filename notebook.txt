## Notes

Code at https://github.com/Fudarakulaszlo/CS2620

Set up socket as seen in class

Wire protocol should have one byte as command and then the message

Store password hashed with SHA256

Created base GUI with tkinter

Registration from GUI does not work, returns error 
Connection error: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xaa in position 0: invalid start byte

Idea to store messages in a dat file with tags
Client will ask for the unread messages periodically, not ideal but easy to implement for now

JSON can't handle bytes, need to update some of the methods to handle JSON as well

For grpc, we need to change our client and server since they are reliant on the socket structure

At such a small scale it is probably the same difficulty as the custom protocol or JSON, but since grpc
is standardized, it is probably easier to work with on a larger scale

It should have smaller message sizes compared to JSON since it is serialized, but still larger than our custom protocol

Now the client uses generated code and instead of the sockets uses stubs, so the connection is basically happening through API calls

Testing also has to change, since we are no longer testing the sockets but using the stubs, this seems easier to do

Actually writing the client and server might have been even a bit easier than before
