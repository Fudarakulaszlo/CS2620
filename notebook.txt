## Notes

Set up socket as seen in class

Wire protocol should have one byte as command and then the message

Store password hashed with SHA256

Created base GUI with tkinter

Registration from GUI does not work, returns error 
Connection error: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xaa in position 0: invalid start byte

Idea to store messages in a dat file with tags
Client will ask for the unread messages periodically, not ideal but easy to implement for now

JSON can't handle bytes, need to update some of the methods to handle JSON as well
